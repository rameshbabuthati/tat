# Trading Bot Project

## Overview
This project implements an automated trading bot based on a modular architecture. The bot integrates multiple data sources and analysis techniques to generate trading signals and execute trades with risk management. The architecture is inspired by the following flow:

```
Market Data ──┬─────────────┐
             │             │
             ▼             │
   Technical Analysis      │
             │             │
             ▼             │
         Signal Fusion ◀───┤
             │             │
             ▼             │
Trade Execution & Risk Management
```

```

```

## Architecture Modules
1. **Market Data**: Fetches real-time and historical market data.
2. **Technical Analysis**: Computes technical indicators and trading signals.
3. **ML Prediction**: Uses machine learning models to predict market trends.
4. **News/Social Data**: Gathers news and social media sentiment data.
5. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes sentiment from news/social data.
6. **Signal Fusion**: Combines signals from technical, ML, and sentiment analysis.
7. **Trade Execution & Risk Management**: Executes trades and manages risk.

## Development Plan
We will implement and test each module step by step:

1. **Market Data**: Implement data fetching and test.
2. **Technical Analysis**: Add technical indicators and test.
3. **ML Prediction**: Integrate ML models and test.
4. **News/Social Data**: Implement data collection and test.
5. **Sentiment Analysis**: Add sentiment analysis and test.
6. **Signal Fusion**: Combine all signals and test.
7. **Trade Execution & Risk Management**: Implement trade logic and risk controls.

## Getting Started
- Clone the repository
- Follow the instructions for each module as they are implemented

## Testing
Each module will include its own tests and example usage.
